```
- I was 16yo foreign student in Texas.
- This year-long project helped me cope with leaving my family behind in eastern Europe.
- It also cultivated a computer scientist, even a ontological computationalist, in me.
- I (stupidly) developed the entire game logic & animations from scratch, only directly using Android 5.0 (API level 21) libraries in my Java code and using JDK to create Gradle builds and JetBrains executables.
- End-to-end and stress tested (APK available for reproducing).

Help Jose escape the Evil Farm! The Angry Farmer and his sidekick monkey will try to stop you, but you cannot give up! The farmer has drained your power and to become strong you need to eat 333 magical golden bacon strips. For the sake of pigginity!**
